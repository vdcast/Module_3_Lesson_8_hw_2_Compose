**Lesson's topic:**

Kotlin Coroutines.

**Task:**

Create a game "Guess the Time". The essence of the game is that you need to guess the time. By pressing the button, the program starts a hidden countdown (randomly 5-20 seconds). When the countdown ends, the user enters how many seconds they think have passed. If the numbers matches - win.

**Result: Screen recoding** (please, note that it was converted to GIF, so it's not smooth as it was):
